### Abstract:

We built an app that can add a url as a bookmark, giving you the option to delete or toggle the bookmark as read. The app keeps count of read, unread, and all bookmarks.

### Installation Instructions:


### Project Background:

This project will help us learn how to build React apps and make an api call to pbtain data and then utilize that data. Our data is broken into two datasets and need to be both utilized. This project is also an opportunity for us to build out a program based on user stories.

### Project Goals:

- Write an app from scratch
- Design and implement our app using JS5 and CSS.
- Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with the CIA data
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)
