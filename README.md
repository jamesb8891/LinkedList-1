# Linked List

### Abstract:

We built an app that can add a url as a bookmark, giving you the option to delete or toggle the bookmark as read. The app keeps count of read, unread, and all bookmarks.

### Installation Instructions:

  * Open your Terminal
  * Type in:
  * git clone https://github.com/jamesb8891/LinkedList-1.git
  * cd LinkedList-1/
  * open index.html
  * must type full url in order for the link to work.
  Ex. https://www.google.com

### Project Background:

This project will help us understand basic DOM manipulation and basic Javascript function writing. Also needed to utilize event delegation's bubbling phase to get our Delete button to work.

### Project Goals:

- Write an app from scratch
- Design and implement our app using JS5 and CSS.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)
